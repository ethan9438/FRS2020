                          Tapgol Park is the first modern park to be built in Seoul, and it was originally built as a temple site to house Wongaksa Temple during the 13th year of the Joseon Dynasty.

                          <br />
                          <p>
                          However, the temple was destroyed under the reign of Yeonsangun and remained closed until 1897, when the provincial advisor, Englishman named John Mcleavy Brown, made a proposal to renovate the site into a park. 
                          </p>
                          <br />
                          <p>
                          The park contains several national treasures, including Wongaksaji Sipcheungseoktap Pagoda (Ten-story Stone Pagoda of Wongaksa Temple Site) and Wongaksabi Stele, and Palgakjeong Pavilion, where the Independence Proclamation was first declared; the independence movement relief plate; and the statue of Son Byeong-hee.

                          The park is of great historical value and national spirit as it was the starting point of the March 1 Independence Movement.

                      It is a half moon-shaped isle, and on it is the grave of General Nami, who led a 
                      great victory against the rebels in the 13th year of the 7th king of the Joseon 
                      dynasty, King Sejo (r. 1455-1468).
                      </p>

                      <p>
                      Namiseom Island is 63 kilometers away from Seoul in the direction of Chuncheon, and is 
                      famous for its beautiful tree lined roads. The island is 30 minutes away from Chuncheon 
                      and an hour away from the suburbs of Seoul. Since it is not far from Seoul, many couples 
                      and families come to visit.
                      </p>
                      <br />
                      <p>
                      A special feature of Namiseom Island is that there are no telephone poles. This is because 
                      all electric wires were built underground to keep the natural feeling of the landscape. 
                      The island is 553,560 square yards with chestnut trees and poplar trees throughout.
                      </p>
                      <br />
                      <p>
                      In the middle of the isle, there is a grass field about 316,320 square yards. It features 
                      education and training facilities and camping sites. The island also has a swimming pool 
                      and water sports facilities for motorboats and water-skiing, as well as a theme park with 
                      a merry-go-round, shooting range, and roller skating rink. Lodging facilities such as resort 
                      villas and bungalows are available for visitors to stay on the island.
